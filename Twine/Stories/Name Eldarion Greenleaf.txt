Name: Violin
Appearance: A short, half-elven boy with pointy ears, large, round glasses, and insecure features. He has messy, brown hair. Violin is small and weak, and often hunches over to avoid drawing attention to his height. He's usually seen wearing green clothes that don't quite fit him well.

Personality: Insecure, shy, and easily intimidated, Violin spends most of his time feeling inferior to those around him. He's head over heels in love with a girl named Kara from the academy, but it's obvious that his feelings are unrequited. At the academy, Violin was frequently humiliated by his classmates due to his small stature and lack of skills in magic or combat. He lives with his older brother, who is talented in everything and constantly reminds Violin of his shortcomings.

Background: Violin is the younger brother of a successful mage and warrior who has always been better than him at everything. His family, embarrassed by his lack of skills and weakness, disowned him and left him with his brother. Violin idolizes his brother and hopes to one day prove himself worthy, but his efforts are constantly thwarted. To make matters worse, Violin's unrequited love for Kara only serves to highlight his insecurities and further isolate him from his peers.
